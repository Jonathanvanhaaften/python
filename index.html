  <header >Introduction</header>
  <p>Python is an open source language that is getting a lot of attention from the 
    market. It combines ease of use with the capability to run on multiple platforms
    because it is implemented focusing on every major operating system.</p>
     <p>Guido van Rossum created the language nearly 11 years ago and since then, 
     Python has changed through the years, turning itself into one of the most
      powerful programming languages currently available.</P>
      <p> Python is a good prototype language. In just a few minutes, you can develop
    prototypes that would take you several hours in other languages.</P>
    <p> It also embodies all object-oriented concepts as part of its core engine.
      Therefore, creating programming object-oriented applications in Python is
       much easier than it would be in other languages such as Java or C++.</p>
    <p>As I just said, Python is an open source project. Consequently,
     it is truly free. No copylefts or copyrights are involved in its 
     license agreement. You can change it, modify it, give it away, sell it,
     and even freely distribute it for commercial use. Its copyright only protects
      the author from legal problems that might occur if someone decides to sue
    the author for errors caused by using Python, or if someone else tries to
    claim ownership of the language. Maybe you still don't know Python,
     but many companies are out there using it. The problem is these companies
     don't want to go public talking about it because they think that using Python
      without getting the attention of their competitors is a good strategy.</p>
    Okay, I know that you are curious to know who in the world is using Python.
    Organizations like Industrial Light and Magic, Yahoo!, Red Hat, 
    and NASA are some of companies that run Python applications.</p>

<section class="main-section" id="Built_in_Data_Types">
       <header > <br>Built in Data Types</header>
       <p>Built-in data types are types that are already built into the interpreter.
        They are divided into two groups:</p>
        <p> Immutable Data Types These objects cannot have their values altered 
        (for example, strings, numbers, and tuples). 
        Mutable Data Types These objects can have their values manipulated 
        (for example, lists and dictionaries). Sometimes, it becomes necessary 
        to assign a null  value to a variable using the special data type known 
        as None:</p>
        <code>  >>> x = 1 >>> x 1 >>> print x 1 >>> x = None >>> x >>></code>
        <p> As you could see, nothing was returned. However, if you try to print this 
        value, the print  method of the object will specially handle the None  
        value by returning a None  result. This is shown in the following:</p>
        <code> >>> print x None</code>   
</section>
    
<section class="main-section" id="Strings" >
       <header><br>Strings</header>
       <p>Python considers a string as a sequence of characters. 
        Therefore, every time you use, for example, the string "Parrot", 
         internally Python handles it as the sequence ["P", "a", "r", "r", "o", "t"].</p>
       <p>The first indexer value is always the number zero. Hence, to have access to the 
       letter P,  you need to say "Parrot"[0]  and to access the letter a,
         you need to say "Parrot"[1].  Using the same concept, we can get access 
         to all the other elements. The following is an example of string operators:</p> 
       <code> >>> "dead parrot " + "sketch" </code>
        <code> # concatenation "dead parrot sketch" >>> "parrot " * 2 </code>            
        <code> # repetition "parrot parrot" >>> "parrot"[1]   </code>             
        <code># indexing "a" >>> "parrot"[-1]  </code>
        <code># indexing backward "t" >>> "parrot"[1:3]</code>             
        <code> # slicing (*) "ar" </code>

<section class="main-section"id="Built_in_Functions">
      <header ><br>Built in Functions</header> 
    
 <p>The following functions are always available when you load the Python 
    interpreter. You don't need to import them because they are already part 
    of the __builtin__  module, which is always imported when you launch Python. 
    apply()  It executes a given function,  passing the arguments provided.
     basic syntax: apply(function, (tuple of positional arguments) 
     [, dictionary of keywords arguments])</p>
      <code> >>> apply (raise_salary, (6000), {'employee':'John', 'id':13})</code>
       <p>Note that starting at Python 1.6, the functionality of apply 
        is now available with normal function calling, such as</p> 
     <code>   >>> args = (6000,) >>> kwargs = { 'employee':'John', 'id':13} </code>
      <code>  >>> raise_salary(*args, **kwargs) coerce()</code>
         <p> coerce  is used to try to convert the two given arguments x 
           and y  to the same type, returning them as a tuple. basic syntax:</p>
          <code>  coerce(  x, y  )  >>> coerce(42,5.4)  (42.0, 5.4) filter()  </code> 
          <p> It creates a new list by taking each element of list  for which
              function  evaluates to true.  basic syntax:
               filter(  function, list  )  >>> a = range (4)</p>
          <code>      >>> b = filter(lambda x: x < 3, a)</code>
        <code>         >>> print b [0,1,2] globals() </code>
                  <p>It returns the global namespace dictionary. basic syntax:</p>
            <code>       globals()  input()  </code>
    <p>It provides an input interface for the user. 
    Only numbers are accepted. basic syntax: </p>
   <code>put(  [prompt]  )  a = input("Please, type a number greater than 5: ")</code>
   <code>  if a<5:     print "a is not greater than 5" locals()  </code>
     <p>It returns the local namespace dictionary basic syntax:</p>
    <code>  locals()  map() </code>
       <p>It applies a function  to each element of list,  producing another list.
        If function  is set to None  and multiple lists are provided, a tuple 
        matrix is generated in the format of a list. basic syntax: </p>
    <code>    map(  function, list  )  >>> lst = map(None, [1,2,3,4], [1,2,3,4,5,6])
         >>> lst [(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (None, 5), (None, 6)] open() </code>
   <p>It opens a file. (See the section "File Handling" for details.) basic syntax:</P>
    <code>open(  filename [,mode [,bufsize]]  )  pow() </code>
     <p>It returns x**y  or (x**y) % z,  depending on the number of arguments 
     that are transported.basic syntax:</p>
    <code>  pow(  x, y [,z]  )  raw_input() </code>
       <p>It reads from standard input ( sys.stdin ), returning the read data as 
       a string. prompt  is an optional text that can be displayed in the screen. 
       basic syntax: </p>
     <code>  raw_input(  [prompt]  )  reduce() </code>
      <p>It applies a function
         cumulatively to the items in sequence  (implied loop), returning a single
          value. initializer  is an optional starting value. basic syntax:</p>
       <code>    reduce(  function, sequence [,initializer]  )</code>
             <p>>>> import operator >>> a = [1,2,3] >>> print reduce(operator.add, a)
        6 The equivalent Python code for this function is something like def
         reduce(func, list):     ret = list[0]     for x in list[1:]:        </p>
        <code>  ret = func(ret, x)     return ret __import__() </code>
    <p>This is a function invoked by the import statement. To import a module, you 
    just need to inform the module name.  basic syntax:</p>
    <code> __import__(  module_name [,globals() [, locals() [,from list]]]  )
       >>> modname = "string" >>> string = __import__(modname) >>> string reload()</code>
   <p>It reloads an already imported module.  Internally, it calls the __import__  
   function. basic syntax:</p>
   <code> reload(  module  )  </code><br>

    <section class="main-section"id="Control_Statements">
        <header ><br>Control Statements</header>
        <p>Python implements all the necessary types of control statements that your program might require. 
            The syntax provided by Python's if, for,  and while  statements should be enough for your needs.
             Tip Remember to type a colon at the end of each line where you enter a statement declaration. 
             if/elif/else  The general syntax for the if/elif/else  statement is as follows:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>1: if < condition >:</li>
               <li>2:     < statements ></li>
                <li>3: [elif < condition >:</li>
                 <li>4:     < statements >] </li>
                 <li>5: [elif < condition >: {}</li>
                 <li>6:     pass] </li>
                 <li>7: â€¦</li>
                  <li>8: [else:</li>
                  <li> 9:     < statements >]</li>
                  </ul>
                    <p>Note that both elif  and else  clauses are optional.
                     As you can see in lines 3 through 7, it is only necessary to use elif  when you need 
                     to handle multiple cases. That is exactly how you implement 
                     the switch/case  statements from other languages. </p>

<section class="main-section"id="Data_Structures">
        <header >Data Structures</header>
        <p>Python implements a variety of data structures, such as lists, tuples, ranges,
          and dictionaries (also known as hash tables ).</p>
          
           <p>Lists </p>
          <p> Lists are mutable 
          sequences of objects indexed by natural numbers that can be changed after 
          they are created. Lists are very flexible and easy to create. 
          They are always enclosed in brackets:</p>
           <code> >>> lst = [1,2,3,4]</code> <p> # this is simple list</p>
         
           <p>Ranges A range is an actual list of integers. The built-in 
            function range()  provides this data structure.</p>
            <code> >>> r = range(2,5) </code>
            <code>>>> print r</code>
             <code>[2,3,4]</code>
             <p>When the first argument is left out, it is assumed to be zero.</p>
         
         
         <p>Tuples </p>
         <p>A tuple is a sequence of immutable Python objects. 
         The general syntax of a tuple is as follows: variable =</p>
         <code> (element1, element2, â€¦)</code>
         
         
         
         
         
         <p>Dictionaries ( hash tables )</p>
         <p> Dictionaries illustrate the only mapping type 
         of Python. They represent finite sets of objects indexed by nearly arbitrary 
         values. I say nearly  because dictionary keys cannot be variables of mutable 
         type, which are compared by value rather than by object identity. 
         Python dictionaries are also known as associative arrays  or hash tables.
           The general syntax of a dictionary is as follows: variable =</p>
            <code>{" key1 ":" value1 ", " key2 ":" value2 ", â€¦} </code>
            <p>Dictionaries are always enclosed in braces. They associate key  
            elements with value  elementsâ€”keys and values are displayed separated 
            by a colon. The values of a dictionary can be of any type, but the keys 
            must be of an immutable data type (such as strings, numbers, or tuples). 
            Dictionary keys have no natural order and are always listed in arbitrary 
            order because it uses a hash  technique to implement a fast lookup.</p>
